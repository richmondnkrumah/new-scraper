## üîÑ Data Fetching & Fallback Mechanism

The application implements a multi-layered fallback strategy to ensure maximum data availability:

### 1. Primary Data Source: Yahoo Finance API
- First attempt to fetch complete financial data
- Provides real-time market data and financial metrics
- Used for: Stock prices, financial statements, key statistics

### 2. Fallback to Gemini AI
- **Triggered When**: 
  - Yahoo Finance returns incomplete data
  - Required fields are missing
  - API rate limits are reached
- **Implementation**: 
  - Uses structured prompts to generate missing financial data
  - Maintains consistent data structure with Yahoo Finance
  - Clearly indicates fallback usage in the UI

### 3. Data Normalization
- Handles different currencies using ExchangeRate-API
- Normalizes financial metrics for accurate comparison
- Converts all values to USD for consistent comparison

### 4. Graceful Degradation
- Continues to function with partial data
- Clearly indicates missing or estimated data points
- Maintains UI consistency even with incomplete data

## üìä How to Use

3. **Analyze Data**:
